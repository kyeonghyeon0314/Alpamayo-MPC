# Manual Driver

The manual driver allows interactive control of the ego vehicle using keyboard input. This is useful for:
- Debugging and exploring simulation scenarios interactively
- Testing specific driving behaviors manually
- Visualizing camera feeds in real-time

## Requirements

- A display (X11 or Wayland) - the manual driver requires a GUI for keyboard input

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| W / UP | Accelerate (increase target speed) |
| S / DOWN | Brake/Decelerate (decrease target speed) |
| A / LEFT | Steer left |
| D / RIGHT | Steer right |
| SPACE | Emergency stop (zero speed) |
| ESC / Q | Quit |

The driver generates constant-curvature arc trajectories based on the current steering angle and speed, which are then tracked by the MPC controller.

## Running the Manual Driver

While the bulk of Alpasim runs inside docker-compose, the manual driver runs as an external service (python script) on your machine - hence the term "external driver" later on.

### Step 1: Start the Manual Driver

From the repository root, start the driver:

```bash
uv run --project src/driver python -m alpasim_driver.main \
  --config-path=configs --config-name=manual
```

The driver will start and display a pygame window showing the camera feed. It binds to `0.0.0.0:6789` by default (all network interfaces).

### Step 2: Launch the Simulator

Run the wizard with the `local_external_driver` deploy config:

```bash
uv run --project src/wizard alpasim_wizard \
  +deploy=local_external_driver \
  wizard.log_dir=$PWD/manual_run \
  scenes.scene_ids='["your-scene-id"]'
```

The runtime will connect to your driver at `localhost:6789`.

### Running Driver on a Separate Machine

If your driver runs on a different host or port, override the address with the driver's external IP (reported in its logs upon launch):

```bash
uv run --project src/wizard alpasim_wizard \
  +deploy=local_external_driver \
  wizard.log_dir=$PWD/manual_run \
  scenes.scene_ids='["your-scene-id"]' \
  wizard.external_services.driver='["192.168.1.100:6789"]'
```

## Configuration

The manual driver configuration is in `src/driver/configs/manual.yaml`. Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `host` | `0.0.0.0` | Interface to bind to (all interfaces) |
| `port` | `6789` | Port to listen on |
| `inference.use_cameras` | `["camera_front_wide_120fov"]` | Camera to display |
| `log_level` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity |

## Simulation Settings

The `local_external_driver` deploy config includes settings optimized for interactive use:

- **10 Hz control rate** (vs. 2 Hz for batch evaluation) for smoother response
- **1920x1080 camera resolution** for better visualization
- **Localhost networking** so containers can reach the external driver

These can be customized by overriding `runtime.simulation_config` on the command line.
