Physics replay service implementation.

Handles N-to-1 decomposition: when the event-based loop sends a single
multi-pose ``ground_intersection`` request where the old loop sent N
per-pose requests, this service decomposes the incoming request into
per-pose sub-requests, matches each against the recorded ASL exchanges,
and merges the responses.
